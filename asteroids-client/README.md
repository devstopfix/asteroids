Asteroids Client
==================

Uses websockets to connect to [an asteroids game server](https://github.com/devstopfix/asteroids-server).

Usage
-----
```
npm install
npm start
```

Implement your client in `./src/app.js`. The server state is received as a `frame` event. The state protocol is described below. The client applies a minimal transformation (`./src/transformFrame.js`) which can be improved. 

Supported Game State Protocol
-----------------------------
```
{
  a:   [    [ id, x, y, r], ... ]           // List of asteroids
  s:   [    [ id, x, y, r, t, col], ... ]   // List of ships
  b:   [    [ id, x, y], ... ]              // List of bullets
  x:   [    [x, y], ... ]                   // List of explosions (only occur once)
  n:   integer                              // Incrementing frame number
  dim: [x, y]                               // The size of the play area (currently 4000.0 x 2250.0)
  hi:  [  [tag, score]  ]                   // Individual high score
  t:   [  [team, score]  ]                  // Team high score
}
